# Command Workflows

Use command templates to keep execution consistent:

1. **Create spec** — draft an initial spec from a problem statement
2. **Enrich user story** — refine spec, generate AC/risk matrix, and draft contracts
3. **Plan from approved spec** — create plan and test plan
4. **Implement from approved plan** — code, traceability, and changelog
5. **Review against spec and quality gates** — validate everything before merge

These commands are tool-agnostic and can be copied into any assistant chat.
