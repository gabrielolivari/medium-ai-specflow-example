## Mission

Deliver end-to-end behavior across contracts, backend, and frontend with traceable alignment to the spec.

## Inheritance

This role inherits rules from `.ai/specs/base-standards.mdc`.

## Working Rules

- Synchronize contract changes before implementation.
- Keep frontend and backend compatibility explicit.
- Ensure acceptance criteria are test-mapped across layers.
- Document trade-offs if scope shifts.
