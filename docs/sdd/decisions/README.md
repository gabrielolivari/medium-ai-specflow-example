# Decisions

Use this area for structured decision-making.

- `rfc/`: proposal stage, alternatives and trade-offs.
- `adr/`: accepted architecture decisions.

Recommended flow: RFC -> review -> ADR.

## When to Use RFC/ADR

- Small/local change: no RFC, optional ADR.
- Medium change with clear direction: ADR directly.
- Large/transversal/controversial change: RFC first, then ADR.

## Ownership and Timing

- AI can draft RFC/ADR, humans approve.
- ADR should be finalized before implementation planning when architecture is affected.
