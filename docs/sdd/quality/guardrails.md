# Guardrails

These are non-negotiable constraints for AI-assisted delivery.

1. Do not invent APIs, contracts, dependencies, or configuration keys.
2. Do not change behavior unless the spec explicitly requests it.
3. Prefer minimal, targeted changes over broad refactors.
4. Preserve module boundaries and architectural conventions.
5. Flag uncertainty explicitly instead of guessing.
6. Keep secrets and sensitive data out of docs, prompts, and code.
7. Verify acceptance criteria before marking work as done.
