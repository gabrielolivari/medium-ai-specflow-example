# SDD Documentation

This directory defines how to run Spec-Driven Development in a consistent and scalable way.

## Structure

- `specs/`: functional specifications, templates, and execution plans (colocated per user story).
- `decisions/`: architecture and major technical decisions.
- `quality/`: validation rules and release readiness.

## SDD Rule

If behavior changes, update the spec first.  
Implementation and tests must match the updated spec.
